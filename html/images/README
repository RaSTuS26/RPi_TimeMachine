- Background Images (wallpapers) go here and the list should be edited in /html/bgImages.js
- Also in /html/date-time-weather.html and /html/weather-forecast.html the Background Image in the <body> tag should be the last image on this list,
  the script will load the first image after 'numSeconds' have elapsed, therefore should then cycle in proper order.
- Dark backgrounds work better with the theme I've used.
- AFAIK my original images are royalty free, but can't be sure, so better you find your own.
